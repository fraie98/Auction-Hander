\section{Synchronization And Communication Issues Resolution}
\noindent As we have seen in section \ref{synchComIssues} the main issues regarding the synchronization and communication are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Maintain a consistent auction state (remaining time, users online, offers made) among the clients
	\item Maintain the list of auctions updated among all the users of the application
	\item Notify a client if something changes (new auction is created, a new offer is made, a new user joins the auction and so on)
\end{itemize}

\noindent These problems are solved using Erlang and Websocket. The server is made entirely in Erlang, thus all the problems regarding the concurrency are handled by the language.

\noindent Apart from this all the remaining communication and synchronization issues are solved because:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Erlang maintains the remaining time (this is done by the auction handler) and all the important information, either regarding a single auction (auction handler) and the overall system state (main server and mnesia db).
	\item Websockets update all the registered clients with the newest information provided by the Erlang part of the application.  
\end{itemize}
