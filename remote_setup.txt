ip 172.18.0.7 -> Erlang server + java listener
ip 172.18.0.6 -> Apache Tomcat webapp + websocket


Instructions to perform the latter setup

*** FOR THE FIRST TIME *** 
0) Use OpenVPN and import file studenti.opvn
1) Connect

DEPLOY APACHE TOMCAT WEBAPP & WEBSOCKET
1) From locally: check in the AuctionHandlerWebApp code for some todo comments in this format "TODO FOR REMOTE CONF" and change the related variable as commented (*)
2) Compile everything and deploy the generated .war file (check target directory) in the Tomcat manager at http://172.18.0.6:8080/manager/html

DEPLOY ERLANG SERVER
1) ssh into 172.18.0.7 and clone the git repository with git clone https://github.com/gerti98/DistributedSystemsProject
2) modify the macros.hrl file as commented (*)
3) go into erlang server and for compiling the erlang server run > make.sh
4) run the erlang server with > run_remote.sh
5) (note on file run_remote.sh: server@172.18.0.7 is good for container at ip 172.18.0.7)

DEPLOY JAVA LISTENER
1) Still from 172.18.0.7 modify comments (*)
2) Run the listener (For running it I've used Jetbrain Gateway which opens an Intellij window inside from the container, I've not found easier way to do so)

All the changes with (*) can be avoided if we push the related modification in the repo

*** FOR THE SECOND TIME AND ON (with no changes in the source code)***
DEPLOY APACHE TOMCAT WEBAPP & WEBSOCKET
0) Already deployed

DEPLOY ERLANG SERVER
1) ssh into 172.18.0.7
2) search and run the erlang server with > run_remote.sh

DEPLOY JAVA LISTENER
1) Run the listener (with Jetbrain gateway or easier solutions if can be found)
