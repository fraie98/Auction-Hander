1) If needed recompile erlang sources by running the make.sh script (in Windows >sh make.sh should work)
2) Run run.sh script
3) On the opened erlang cli run:
            > my_supervisor:start_link().
   Or if you want to run the main server without the supervisor (not tested after the addition of the supervisor) run:
            > main_server:start_main_server().
